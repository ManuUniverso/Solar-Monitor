# Solar-Monitor
Monitoring of the solar energy system is facilitated directly through the readings from the VE.Direct port present on the Vitron Energy MPPT and Inverter devices. An ESP32 screen, an ILI9341 display with the touch function used to navigate through various menus are used.

It has many bugs that I am still correcting but it is useful to do a first test and read the direct view. No data is sent to the inverter or MPPT, it is only reading and monitoring.
