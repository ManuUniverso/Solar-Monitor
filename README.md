# Solar-Monitor
Monitoring the solar energy system is directly facilitated through port readings VE.Direct present in Vitron Energy devices. An ESP32 and an ILI9341 screen are utilized, with the touch function employed to navigate various menus.

It has many bugs that I am still correcting but it can be used to do a first test and read the ve direct. No data is sent to the inverter or MPPT, it is only reading and monitoring.
